# Contributing Content

### Overview

This documentation is organized into the following areas:

1. **Technical SEO**: This is to be an organized and wikipedia-style area covering the major informational areas of Technical SEO.  We will go with the Russ Jones definition of Technical SEO and extend the realm into: Crawling, Rendering, Indexing, Data Science, and Machine Learning.  Initial areas to construct are the first three.
2. **JavaScript**: Resources for Beginning with JavaScript, Code Examples, Chrome DevTools information. Would be good to separate Node and Google AppScript code.
3. **Python**: Resources for Beginning with Python, Code Examples, Data Science Resources, and other helpful code snippets.
4. **R Stats**: Resources for Beginning with R Stats, Code Examples, etc.



### Working with Pages

Here are a few points about pages:

#### If the parent page is left blank, it will include a section listing of children pages.

#### 

#### Key page information should be filled just like a normal web page

#### Use the available content types to make the page as clear as possible.

With this said, it is critical to keep consistently of formatting between sections.  For a specific content type, if a convention is used in one section, it should be used in all.  Users should expect the same experience and understanding of where to find things across sections.

### Training Resources

**&lt;Language&gt; Overview** sections are areas of training for the language.  This should include information on Installation, libraries, etc.  major thematic areas within a language can be broken out into separate sections.  In many cases it is a good idea to link to really well done resources online covering different aspects for a language.  If we are referencing a resource online, below is the correct format:

Where the resources online are narrowly relevant to Technical SEO needs, we should provide the content tailored to typical workflows.



### Code Examples

All code examples sections should be organized into consistent major thematic areas of Technical SEO.  Currently:

* Knowledge Graph
* Page Speed
* Query Management
* Crawling
* Rendering
* Indexing
