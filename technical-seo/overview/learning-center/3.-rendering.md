Google's Martin Splitt has spent a tremendous amount of time over the last year educating developers and SEOs on the limitations of Google's ability to render JavaScript websites.

Key Items we Know about Google's Web Rendering Service \(WRS\).

* It uses a near-up-to-date version of Google Chrome.
* Google doesn't use cookies \(they do seem to persist cookies across 30X requests\).
* Service workers are not allowed by Googlebot.
* Google overrides random number functions to ensure a predictable state.
* The Live Test \(Fetch and Render\) in Google Search Console, is different from Googlebot.  Live Test is time sensitive, Googelbot is not.
* Googlebot will try to wait until there are no longer network activity by the headless browser.
* The date and time of crawling and indexing may differ.  Google may index what they have if the crawl and render fails.
* Googlebot does not need to paint pixels as the service runs Chromium headless, so it omits that step of the render process.
