# 2. Crawling

Google's Search Index contains [hundred of billions of webpages and is over 100,000,000 gigibytes \(100k Terabytes\) in size](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/crawling-indexing/).  In order to feed that index, Google uses [Googlebot](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en), the generic name for Google's web crawling infrastructure, to search for new pages, and add to a list of known pages. Bing uses [Bingbot](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/which-crawlers-does-bing-use-8c184ec0) as their standard crawler. Both Google and Bing use desktop and mobile User-Agents to crawl the web.
