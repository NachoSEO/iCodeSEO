### Crawl of the top ranking pages for airline tickets keywords

This dataset contains SERPs of the 100 most popular tourist destinations, two variations each,  and for two countries \(400 queries\). The landing pages that ranked for those keywords were scraped and the two tables were merged into one big table.
