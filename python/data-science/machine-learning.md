# Machine Learning

## Pytorch

### [HuggingFace Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)

Transformers \(formerly known as `pytorch-transformers` and `pytorch-pretrained-bert`\) provides state-of-the-art general-purpose architectures \(BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNet, CTRL...\) for Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) and Natural Language Generation \(NLG\) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

## TensorFlow

### [Uber Ludwig](https://github.com/uber/ludwig)

Ludwig is a toolbox built on top of TensorFlow that allows users to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code.

All you need to provide is a CSV file containing your data, a list of columns to use as inputs, and a list of columns to use as outputs, Ludwig will do the rest. Simple commands can be used to train models both locally and in a distributed way, and to use them to predict new data.
